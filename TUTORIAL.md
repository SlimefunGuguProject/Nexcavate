# Nexcavate Tutorial

## Getting Started

In the Slimefun guide, there will be a category called "Nexcavate".

When you open it, you will see that most items are locked, with the exception of the Research Table.

Clicking on the Research Table yields a Structure Viewer.<br>
The icon on the left indicates that this assembly should be built in the world.<br>
The layers on the right show which layer is currently being displayed, and lets you switch layers. <br>
In the center are the contents of that layer, or the blocks that should be placed in the world (similar to a MultiBlock).
Unlike a MultiBlock, this layer is horizontal rather than vertical.

Once you gather the materials and build it according to the recipe, it should look something like this:

Interacting with the research table will begin a cutscene that explains some lore.

Once the cutscene ends, a research screen will open, presenting you with a variety of research options. (Each stained glass is an available research.)

The cutscene said to research a **Rediscovery Pickaxe**, the first basic tool to obtain your first **ancient parts**.<br>
It is also the only research that you are able to complete, as every other research has an ancient part requirement.<br>
Clicking on the stained glass for Rediscovery Pickaxe will begin the research.<br>
(The progress display only updates when you click on the GUI or re-open the GUI, which is why it may appear frozen at first.)

Once the research is completed, a chat message will appear, and you will be able to view its recipe.<br>
Once you have researched a recipe, you can view it through the Slimefun guide without re-opening a resesarch station.<br>
The Rediscovery Pickaxe is created in a normal Enhanced Crafting table.

With your brand-new tool, you can now collect ancient parts.<br>
Mining blocks found in the Nether gives a chance for it to drop an ancient part.<br>
Some blocks are more likely to drop ancient parts than others. Particularly, blocks found in Bastion Remnants have a much higher concentration of ancient parts.

Once you have gathered some parts, you can use them to research more items in the Research Table, such as the Assembler, Item Holder, Blackstone Cast, and Part Extractor.

The Assembler is constructed in the world, similar to the Research Table.

To assemble an assembly (such as the Item Holder, which is necessary for the other assemblies), place the recipe in the center of an assembler.<br>
Then right-click the chiseled quartz block to activate the assembler.

Item Holders are used to place non-placeable items, such as ancient parts, in assemblers.<br>
Putting ancient parts in Item Holders is necessary to craft a Blackstone Cast.<br>
Place the Item Holder in the correct spot in the assembler, then right click it to place an item in.

The Blackstone Cast can only be placed in the Nether, and requires electricity.<br>
It also requires a lava source block to be directly below it.<br>
Once all of those conditions are met, it will start generating blackstone.<br>
The blackstone can be fed into a cargo network. 

The Part Extractor is assembled similarly. <br>
It turns blackstone into ancient parts at a slower rate (so you will need multiple extractors to keep up with one cast).

This allows you to automate ancient part production, eventually allowing you to build the **Research Lab**.<br>
The rest should be self-explanatory, with similar mechanics.<br>

Your end goal is to create the **Civilization Core**, which will complete your quest of rekindling the ancient civilization (and making the Nether "come alive" ;)
