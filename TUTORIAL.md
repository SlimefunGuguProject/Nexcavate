## Getting Started

In the Slimefun guide, there will be a category called "Nexcavate".

When you open it, you will see that most items are locked, with the exception of the Research Table.

Clicking on the Research Table yields a Structure Viewer.<br>
The icon on the left indicates that this assembly should be built in the world.<br>
The layers on the right show which layer is currently being displayed, and lets you switch layers. <br>
In the center are the contents of that layer, or the blocks that should be placed in the world (similar to a MultiBlock).
Unlike a MultiBlock, this layer is horizontal rather than vertical.
